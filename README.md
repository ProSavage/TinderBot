## Tinder Bot

### Why? What is wrong with you?
- This is a bot I made for fun to automate using tinder, because I would rather spend 10 hours writing an application than the actual 5 hours I would've used Tinder.
- It's fun.
- Im stupid.

### Tech Stack
- Kotlin (duh) - It's better than java.
- Selenium - for web automation.
- Haystack for image classification.
- Chromedriver - allows you to actually talk to chrome. 

### How I decided to classify women.
I decided to rate women out of a scale from 0 - 10. Ofcourse, looks are not everything,
so, I decided to add the following extra ways for a woman to earn more points in the system.

- Use machine learning first to get an initial index, based on looks.
- Bio, look for specific keywords - add a specific amount of points based on this.
- Location/School - I would prefer for the woman to go to the same school/location.
